  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>
    This implementation guide is about to help data processing responsible to defines how his FHIR data will be processed.
    It also helps him sharing his process and reasons to data consumers.

    The main resource AnonymizationOperation defines all operations that can be done on FHIR resources.

  <h3>Technical Overview</h3>
  <p>
    This IG is meant to be used by an Anonymization Tool. This tool should be able to fetch data from a FHIR endpoint or a least files,
    perform alterations on values and perform aggregations on datasets. This anonymization tool should be able to generate altered FHIR resources.

  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="background.html">Background</a>
      - provides business context for the implementation guide and information that implementers should be
      familiar with before reading the remainder of the IG. There could be multiple pages for this.
